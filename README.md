# Every single day üïê


A simple application for android that will simplify such a routine task as a photo of a working day

## About the app üì±

If you have been in a situation where you were forced to take a photo of a working day - I sympathize. In addition to your own work, you also have to write down everything that you have done, and this takes a lot of time. For the sake of solving this problem, I wrote this simple application - entered a phrase, pressed a button - ready. It's easier than pronofunctional to-do lists.


## Release ‚òëÔ∏è
